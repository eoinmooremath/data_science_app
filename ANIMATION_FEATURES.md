## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive animation capabilities inspired by the user's excellent boids simulation example. The system now supports real-time animated visualizations with smooth performance and interactive controls.

## üöÄ New Animation Tools

### 1. **AnimationFrameTool** (`animation_frame`)

**Usage Example**:
```
"Create an animated scatter plot from the time_series_animation dataset using 'time' as the frame column"
```
