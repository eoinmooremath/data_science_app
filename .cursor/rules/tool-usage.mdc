I want to have the model have access to a large number of statistical tools, by exposing individual functions with smart organization.

Hierarchical Discovery - LLM can reason at different levels:

"I need preprocessing" → explores preprocessing.*
"I need to scale" → explores preprocessing.scale.*

"I need robust scaling" → uses preprocessing.scale.RobustScaler
